## 💭 About

**Duskrise** was a stylish website made for a Minecraft server I helped develop.  
Unfortunately, the server project was **cancelled** before launch...  
But the website remains — and hey, my skin is still on there if anyone cares 😄

This project is small, clean, and built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a few cool animations and UI touches.
